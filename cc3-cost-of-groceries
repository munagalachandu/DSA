/*Cost of Groceries
Chef visited a grocery store for fresh supplies. There are N items in the store where the ith item has a freshness value A[i] and cost B[i]
Chef has decided to purchase all the items having a freshness value greater than equal to X. Find the total cost of the groceries Chef buys.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X â€” the number of items and the minimum freshness value an item should have.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, the array A, denoting the freshness value of each item.
The third line contains N space-separated integers, the array B, denoting the cost of each item.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the total cost of the groceries Chef buys.
